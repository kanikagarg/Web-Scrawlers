    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll build a web scraper to extract job listings from a popular job search platform. We'll extract job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main steps we'll follow in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup our development environment\n",
    "2. Understand the basics of web scraping\n",
    "3. Analyze the website structure of our job search platform\n",
    "4. Write the Python code to extract job data from our job search platform\n",
    "5. Save the data to a CSV file\n",
    "6. Test our web scraper and refine our code as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this project, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and HTML structure. In addition, you may want to use the following packages in your Python environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- requests\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- csv\n",
    "- datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages should already be installed in Coursera's Jupyter Notebook environment, however if you'd like to install additional packages that are not included in this environment or are working off platform you can install additional packages using `!pip install packagename` within a notebook cell such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `!pip install requests`\n",
    "- `!pip install BeautifulSoup`"

    "#### Objective:\n",
    "To develop a web scraping tool that retrieves job postings from Google's career website based on a specified role. The tool will extract job title, location, seniority level, and minimum requirements, providing this information to users efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Requirements Gathering\n",
    "Understand User Needs: Determine the specific roles and job details users are interested in.\n",
    "Target Website: Identify the structure of Google's career website and the specific pages to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Tool Selection\n",
    "Web Scraping Tools: Use libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium.\n",
    "BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and XML documents.\n",
    "Scrapy: For more advanced crawling and scraping needs.\n",
    "Selenium: For dynamic content rendering that requires JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Data Fields to Extract\n",
    "Job \n",
    "\n",
    "Title\n",
    "\n",
    "Location\n",
    "\n",
    "Seniority Level\n",
